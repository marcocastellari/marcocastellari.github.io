# 1 - Work Experience
## 1.1 - R&D Firmware Engineer in Motorsport
#### _Mectronik s.r.l., May 2023 -- Present_
__Embedded Firmware and Hardware designer for Motorsport datalogger and dashboard__
- todo

## 1.2 - Racetrack engineer 
#### _Extreme Racing Service - CIV 2024_
#### _LN Racing - Pirelli Cup 2023_

## 1.3 - R&D Software Engineer
#### _SACMI Imola, Apr 2018 -- April 2023_
__Embedded FW-SW Engineer for Automation__
- The design of automation machinery is growing faster not only in terms of processes to control but also in complexity and big data processing. Hence, more computational power is required and new solutions to manage the real-time data processing must be investigated. In fact, this work has the aim to develop new architectural solutions employing GPU to take advantage of the huge parallelism to accelerate data processing.

# 2 - Education
## 2.1 - MSc in Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering
#### _Università degli Studi di Ferrara, Sep 2015 -- Mar 2018_
#### _Grade: 110/110 With Honors_

- __Thesis__: "Performances Evaluation of Emerging Technologies FPGAs"
- __Main topics__: FPGAs, RRAM, simulation
- The goal of this thesis is to characterize and modelling variability and reliability, taking into account also performances and power consumption, both in commercial FPGAs and RRAM-based FPGAs. The purpose is to evaluate the overall performances and reliability of a consolidated CMOS technology compared to the emerging RRAM technology.

## 2.3 - BSc in Electronic and Computer Science Engineering
#### _Università degli Studi di Ferrara, Sep 2012 -- Jul 2015_
#### _Grade: 110/110_

- __Thesis__: "Localization Systems based on LTE Signals of Opportunity"
- __Main topics__: LTE, passive localization, simulation, telecommunication 
- This study has the aim to investigate the possibility to use signals of opportunity, as LTE, to detect and localize targets. The main reasons to study this topic are the system cost reduction, the intrinsic security and the environmental impact as a green technology.

## 2.4 - High School Diploma in Electronic and Telecommunications Industrial Technician
#### _ITIS G. Marconi (Lugo), Sep 2007 -- Jul 2012_
#### _Grade: 100/100 With Honors_

- __Exam Project__: "Obstacle Avoiding Robot Veichle"

# 3 - Summer Internship 

## 3.1 - Fermilab Summer Internship
#### _Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory at Technical Division, Batavia (USA, IL), Jul 2017 -- Sep 2017_
- __Research field__: "Novel RF Tuning of Jacketed Multi-Cell SRF Cavities"
- __Main topics__: SRF cavity, Bead-Pull RF Measurement System, FEM, simulation 
- Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities have a huge impact in the particle accelerator science because of their ultra-low loss. The attention of this project has been focused on multicell SRF cavities with the aim to provide a solution for dressed cavities that have field flatness issue of being lower than what is acceptable for cryomodule assembly. A tuning procedure for dressed multi-cell cavities capable of controlling the deformation of each single cell has been developed, both theoretically, with FEM analysis, and experimentally, with tests to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach and develop the full tuning procedure.

## 3.2 - MPSoC Research Group
#### _Università degli Studi di Ferrara, Aug 2015 --- Sep 2015_
- __Research__: "Optical Interconnection Networks for High-Performance computing"
- __Main topics__: Photonics, WRONoC, HPC, simulation
- The emerging class of big data applications is challanged by the processing of a huge amount of data in real-time and photonics seems to be an enabling technology for these extreme data processing requirements. Thus, the aim is to develop a software tool to explore all the possible topology for Wavelength-Routed Optical Network-on-Chip (WRONoC) and giude the designer in populating the network topology design space through a systematic methodology.
